Package relbot_simulator
-----------------------------------------------
### Description 
This package implements a simulated relbot. Model generated by 20-sim

### Inputs
`/image`  
        Type: sensor_msgs/msg/Image  
        
`/input/motor_cmd`  
        Type: relbot_msgs/msg/RelbotMotors  
        Combined flaot message. Exists out of `left_wheel_vel` and `right_wheel_vel`

### Outputs
`/output/camera_position`  
        Type: geometry_msgs/msg/PointStamped
        X,Y position of camera centre on input image

`/output/moving_camera`  
        Type: sensor_msgs/msg/Image  
        sub-image of input. Depends on X/ thetaZ of relbot position


`/output/robot_pose`  
        Type: geometry_msgs/msg/PoseStamped  
        Pose of the relbot. Expressed in X, Y, Theta Z

`/turtle1/cmd_vel`  
        Type: geometry_msgs/msg/Twist  
        Twist calculated from relbot movement. Used to command a turtlesim for visualisation.

### Run
In a terminal run either of the following commands:
`ros2 run relbot_simulator relbot_simulator`  
`ros2 relbot_launch relbot_system.launch.py`

### Parameters
double `image_stream_FPS` : Sets the output rate of image stream. Default = 30 FPS, which most webcams have 
double `throttle_rate`: sets throttle rate of ros_log messages. Only publishes first message after `throttle_rate` amount of ms has passed.
double `visualisation_frequency`: sets the output frequency towards turtlesim. Default 62.5

### Core components 
* `dynamics_timer_callback()`: Calls and runs the model every simulation timestep
* `webcam_topic_callback()`: Ingests and passes on webcam image stream
* `CreateCVSubimage()`: Creates sub-image which is then published on /output/moving_camera
